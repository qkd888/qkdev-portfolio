            <p>Hello, My name is Quintin Kelly Dekker</p>
            <p>
                I am fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily
                inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever they
                take me. I’m passionate, expressive, and a multi-talented spirit with
                a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to just
                come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on
                them.
      </p>
